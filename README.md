# 🛠️ Career Rebuild: My 30-Day Dev Journey

Hi! I'm Abu — an ex-Amazon QA turned future Software Engineer / SDET.  
After years of manual QA work and burnout, I'm rebuilding my tech career with purpose, code, and consistency.

This repo tracks my 30-day commitment to:
- Finish core dev courses (CS50P, Boot.dev)
- Build real projects (100 Days of Python)
- Learn automation (Selenium, PyTest)
- Push code consistently
- Regain my confidence as a developer 💪
