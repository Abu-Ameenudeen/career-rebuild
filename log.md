- Added validation logic with getters and setters
- Completed "Encapsulation" chapter in Boot.dev OOP course

---

### 📅 Day 4 – July 13, 2025
✅ Progress:

🧠 CS50P Week 8 (Object-Oriented Programming)
– Watched up to 1 hour 40 minutes of the lecture.
– Covered: defining classes, instantiating objects, encapsulation with private attributes, and @property.

🐍 100 Days of Code – Day 01: Band Name Generator
– Completed project using Object-Oriented Programming.
– Created BandNameGenerator class with input handling and name generation.
– Structured project cleanly under day_01/, created .gitignore, and set up Git repository.
– Learned about .pyc files, __pycache__, and Git best practices.

🧑‍💻 Boot.dev – OOP Course
– Finished the Abstraction chapter.
– Understood the importance of hiding complexity using public methods and internal logic separation.

---

### 📅 Day 5 - July 14, 2025

✅ Completed
- 🔹 **Boot.dev (OOP Track)**
  - Finished optional coding challenges in the **Abstraction** chapter
- 🔹 Worked on the `ocr_api` project:
  - Continued development and debugging
  - Integrated learning into real-world code

🔜 Next Steps
- 📘 Resume **CS50P Week 8** – start the coding exercises
- 📘 Boot.dev – Start **Inheritance** chapter in OOP
- 🐍 100 Days of Code – Continue with **Day 2** (use OOP, type hints, and testing)

---

### 📅 Day 6 - July 15, 2025

✅ Completed
- 🔹 Built an **OCR API using FastAPI** with EasyOCR
  - API accepts image uploads and returns extracted text
  - Learned about request handling, async functions, and directory structure
- 🔹 **Boot.dev (OOP Track)**
  - Completed exercises in the **Inheritance** chapter

🔜 Next Steps
- 📘 Boot.dev – Continue with **Polymorphism**
- 🐍 100 Days of Code – Start **Day 2** project (OOP + type hints + testable code)
- 🧪 Add unit tests to OCR API

---

### 📅 Day 7 - July 16, 2025

✅ Completed:
- 📘 100 Days of Code - Day 2
  - Rebuilt the Tip Calculator using a class-based approach.
  - Focused on getting more comfortable with writing modular code using classes.
  - Practiced using Python type hints in a real-world style example.

🧠 Notes:
- Continued building foundational skills in class design and type hinting.
- Emphasis on clarity and step-by-step progression toward clean, modular code.

---

### 📅 Day 8 - July 17, 2025

✅ Completed:
- 🧠 Built a working **OCR + LLM Summarizer** pipeline:
  - OCR: Extracted text from both digital and scanned PDFs using Tesseract.
  - Sent extracted text to local LLM (DeepSeek via LM Studio) for summarization.
  - Saved summarized output to timestamped `.txt` files in `static/summaries/`.

🛠️ Tech Stack:
- Python, FastAPI
- Tesseract OCR
- LM Studio (DeepSeek LLM)
- File handling (PDF, text)

🧠 Notes:
- Implemented PDF type detection (scanned vs digital).
- Practiced FastAPI routing, file upload handling, and modular code organization.
- Improved integration between OCR and LLM for document summarization.

---

### 📅 Day 9 - July 18, 2025

**Progress:**
- ✅ Tested the `ocr_llm_summarizer` project on Windows using Git Bash
- ✅ Confirmed it works properly in a Windows environment
- ✅ Added support for accepting `.txt` files as input
- ✅ Created a detailed `README.md` for setup and usage instructions

**Thoughts:**
- Good progress on cross-platform testing and usability.
- Clean documentation will help others (and future me!) use the tool easily.

---

### 📅 Day 10 - July 19, 2025

**Progress:**
- Fixed bugs in the summarizer flow.
- Updated API to return the generated summary in the response JSON.

---

### 📅 Day 11 - July 20, 2025

**Progress:**
- ✅ Completed CS50P Week 8 OOP lecture (Object-Oriented Programming).
- Learned about classes, objects, `__init__`, `__str__`, encapsulation, properties, class methods, inheritance, and more.
- ✅ Practiced OOP exercises on Boot.dev to reinforce concepts.
- 🔜 Ready to begin CS50P Week 8 coding exercises for hands-on practice.

---

### 📅 Day 12 - July 21, 2025

**Progress:**
- 🔍 Started researching and exploring the PaddleOCR model for improved OCR support.
- ⚙️ Attempted setup of PaddleOCR on the local machine.
- 🐛 Faced dependency issues during installation; debugging in progress.

---

### 📅 Day 13 – July 22, 2025
