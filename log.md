# 🗓️ 30-Day Progress Log

This file tracks my daily learning progress during my career rebuild challenge.

---

### 🗓️ Day 1 – July 10, 2025
- ✅ Created `career-rebuild` repo on GitHub
- ✅ Added 30-day roadmap and learning structure to README
- ✅ Recommitted to CS50P Week 8 (OOP) and boot.dev goals

---

### 🗓️ Day 2 – July 11, 2025
- ✅ Used cs50.dev cloud VS Code to practice OOP (CS50P Week 8)
- ✅ Watched first 30 minutes of lecture (total 2h 48m)
- ✅ Built a `Student` class with `__init__` and `__str__`
- ✅ Modularized code: moved class to `student/student.py` + `__init__.py`
- 📌 Plan: Set up local Python environment and try 3 CS50P exercises tomorrow

---

### 🗓️ Day 3 – July 12, 2025

- Learned `@property` method in Python OOP
- Built `Person` and `Student` classes with encapsulation
- Added validation logic with getters and setters
- Completed "Encapsulation" chapter in Boot.dev OOP course

### 📅 Day 4 – July 13, 2025
✅ Progress:

🧠 CS50P Week 8 (Object-Oriented Programming)
– Watched up to 1 hour 40 minutes of the lecture.
– Covered: defining classes, instantiating objects, encapsulation with private attributes, and @property.

🐍 100 Days of Code – Day 01: Band Name Generator
– Completed project using Object-Oriented Programming.
– Created BandNameGenerator class with input handling and name generation.
– Structured project cleanly under day_01/, created .gitignore, and set up Git repository.
– Learned about .pyc files, __pycache__, and Git best practices.

🧑‍💻 Boot.dev – OOP Course
– Finished the Abstraction chapter.
– Understood the importance of hiding complexity using public methods and internal logic separation.

### 📅 Day 5 - July 14, 2025

✅ Completed
- 🔹 **Boot.dev (OOP Track)**
  - Finished optional coding challenges in the **Abstraction** chapter
- 🔹 Worked on the `ocr_api` project:
  - Continued development and debugging
  - Integrated learning into real-world code

🔜 Next Steps
- 📘 Resume **CS50P Week 8** – start the coding exercises
- 📘 Boot.dev – Start **Inheritance** chapter in OOP
- 🐍 100 Days of Code – Continue with **Day 2** (use OOP, type hints, and testing)

---

### 📅 Day 6 - July 15, 2025

✅ Completed
- 🔹 Built an **OCR API using FastAPI** with EasyOCR
  - API accepts image uploads and returns extracted text
  - Learned about request handling, async functions, and directory structure
- 🔹 **Boot.dev (OOP Track)**
  - Completed exercises in the **Inheritance** chapter

🔜 Next Steps
- 📘 Boot.dev – Continue with **Polymorphism**
- 🐍 100 Days of Code – Start **Day 2** project (OOP + type hints + testable code)
- 🧪 Add unit tests to OCR API

---

### Day 16 - July 16, 2025

✅ Completed:
- 📘 100 Days of Code - Day 2
  - Rebuilt the Tip Calculator using a class-based approach.
  - Focused on getting more comfortable with writing modular code using classes.
  - Practiced using Python type hints in a real-world style example.

🧠 Notes:
- Continued building foundational skills in class design and type hinting.
- Emphasis on clarity and step-by-step progression toward clean, modular code.
